# US Government Open Data MCP

An MCP server + TypeScript SDK for **39 U.S. government and international data APIs** — 212 tools covering economic, fiscal, health, education, energy, environment, lobbying, housing, patents, safety, banking, consumer protection, workplace safety, transportation, seismic, clinical trials, pharma payments, research funding, and legislative data.

Works with any MCP client (VS Code Copilot, Claude Desktop, Cursor) via **stdio or HTTP Stream**. Supports **selective module loading** and standalone **SDK imports** for use without MCP.

Built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/punkpeye/fastmcp). Disk-cached, rate-limited, retries with backoff.

I did collapse all older commits into a single commit hence the large initial commit. This was to consolidate as well as get rid of many old files that were no longer relevant to the project when I made it public.

## Quick Start

```bash
npx us-gov-open-data-mcp
```

### VS Code / Copilot

Add to `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "us-gov-open-data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "us-gov-open-data-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FRED_API_KEY": "your_key",
        "DATA_GOV_API_KEY": "your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "us-gov-open-data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "us-gov-open-data-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "FRED_API_KEY": "your_key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### HTTP Stream (for web apps, remote access)

```bash
# Start on port 8080
node dist/server.js --transport httpStream --port 8080

# Or via npm script
npm run start:http
```

The HTTP Stream endpoint will be at `http://localhost:8080/mcp`. Works with any MCP client that supports HTTP transport.

### Selective Module Loading

Load only the modules you need for faster startup and smaller tool lists:

```bash
# Via CLI flag
node dist/server.js --modules fred,treasury,congress

# Via environment variable
MODULES=fred,bls,treasury node dist/server.js

# Combine with HTTP transport
node dist/server.js --modules fred,treasury --transport httpStream --port 8080
```

Available module names: `treasury`, `fred`, `bls`, `bea`, `eia`, `census`, `fec`, `congress`, `federal-register`, `usaspending`, `sec`, `fbi`, `govinfo`, `noaa`, `usda-nass`, `world-bank`, `cdc`, `naep`, `college-scorecard`, `nrel`, `fda`, `epa`, `senate-lobbying`, `regulations`, `usda-fooddata`, `fema`, `nhtsa`, `cms`, `hud`, `uspto`, `cfpb`, `fdic`, `dol`, `usgs`, `clinical-trials`, `bts`, `open-payments`, `nih`, `doj-news`

## API Keys

21 APIs require **no key at all** (Treasury, Federal Register, USAspending, World Bank, CDC, FDA, EPA, NAEP, Senate Lobbying, FEMA, NHTSA, CMS, USPTO, CFPB, FDIC, USGS, ClinicalTrials.gov, BTS, Open Payments, NIH RePORTER, DOJ News). The rest need free keys — most take under a minute to get:

| Key | Where to get it | Used by |
|-----|----------------|---------|
| `DATA_GOV_API_KEY` | [api.data.gov/signup](https://api.data.gov/signup/) | Congress, FEC, FBI, GovInfo, College Scorecard, NREL, Regulations.gov, USDA FoodData |
| `FRED_API_KEY` | [fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikeys](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/apikeys) | FRED |
| `CENSUS_API_KEY` | [api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) | Census |
| `BLS_API_KEY` | [bls.gov/developers](https://www.bls.gov/developers/) | BLS (optional — works without, higher limits with) |
| `BEA_API_KEY` | [apps.bea.gov/API/signup](https://apps.bea.gov/API/signup/) | BEA |
| `EIA_API_KEY` | [eia.gov/opendata/register.php](https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php) | EIA |
| `NOAA_API_KEY` | [ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/cdo-web/token) | NOAA |
| `USDA_NASS_API_KEY` | [quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api](https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api) | USDA NASS |
| `HUD_USER_TOKEN` | [huduser.gov/hudapi/public/register](https://www.huduser.gov/hudapi/public/register) | HUD |
| `SEC_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Any valid email | SEC EDGAR |
| `DOL_API_KEY` | [data.dol.gov/registration](https://data.dol.gov/registration) | DOL (OSHA, WHD, UI Claims) |

Set keys via environment variables or a `.env` file in the project root.

## Using as a TypeScript SDK

Every API is importable as a standalone typed client — no MCP server required:

```typescript
// Individual module imports
import { getObservations } from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk/fred";
import { getIndicator } from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk/world-bank";
import { getLeadingCausesOfDeath } from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk/cdc";
import { searchBills } from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk/congress";

// Or barrel import everything
import * as sdk from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk";
const gdp = await sdk.fred.getObservations("GDP", { sort: "desc", limit: 5 });
```

```typescript
// FRED
const gdp = await getObservations("GDP", { sort: "desc", limit: 5 });
console.log(gdp.observations); // [{ date: "2025-10-01", value: "31490.07" }, ...]

// World Bank — compare U.S. to Germany
const health = await getIndicator("SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD", { country: "US;DE", dateRange: "2015:2023" });

// CDC
const deaths = await getLeadingCausesOfDeath({ state: "California", year: 2017 });
```

All SDK functions include disk-backed caching, retry with exponential backoff, and token-bucket rate limiting. See [docs/sdk.md](docs/sdk.md) for the full API reference.

## Architecture

```
src/
  client.ts              # createClient() factory — cache, retry, rate-limit
  server.ts              # FastMCP bootstrap — stdio + HTTP, selective loading
  instructions.ts        # Cross-referencing guide for MCP clients
  sdk/
    index.ts             # Barrel export for all SDK modules
    fred.ts, bls.ts, ... # Typed API clients (no MCP dependency)
  modules/
    fred.ts, bls.ts, ... # MCP tool definitions + metadata
```

Each API is 2 files:
- **`sdk/*.ts`** — typed async functions, usable anywhere (no MCP/Zod dependency)
- **`modules/*.ts`** — MCP tool definitions wrapping the SDK, with metadata for client instructions

Adding a new API: create `sdk/new-api.ts` + `modules/new-api.ts`, add 2 lines to `server.ts`. See [docs/adding-modules.md](docs/adding-modules.md).

## Disclaimer

This project was built with the assistance of AI tools. All data is sourced from official U.S. government and international APIs — the server does not generate, modify, or editorialize any data. It returns raw results from federal databases exactly as provided.

**Important:**
- Data accuracy depends on the upstream government APIs. Numbers may lag days to years behind reality depending on the source.
- Correlation does not imply causation. Cross-referencing data sources (e.g., campaign finance + legislative votes) shows documented patterns, not proven cause-and-effect.
- This tool is for research and informational purposes. It is not legal, financial, medical, or policy advice.
- API rate limits and availability vary. Some endpoints may be temporarily unavailable or return incomplete data.
- The example analyses in the `examples/` folder demonstrate the server's capabilities and should not be treated as investigative conclusions.
