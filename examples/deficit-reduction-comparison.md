# How to Fix the Deficit: The Best Democratic Plan vs. The Best Republican Plan

> All data pulled live from Treasury Fiscal Data, FRED, BLS, BEA, USAspending, World Bank, Census, and Congress.gov on February 26, 2026 using the US Government Open Data MCP server.

> **Important:** This analysis presents federal data and international comparisons — not opinions. Correlation is not causation. When a policy coincides with an economic outcome, we note the correlation but do not claim the policy caused the outcome. Economic results are shaped by hundreds of variables — Fed policy, global events, demographics, technological change, and decades of accumulated decisions by both parties. The numbers here are what they are. The interpretations are clearly labeled. Readers should draw their own conclusions.

## The Problem in One Page

As of February 25, 2026, the United States federal government:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Total national debt** | **$38.76 trillion** | Treasury debt_to_penny |
| **Annual GDP** | $31.49 trillion (Q4 2025) | FRED GDP |
| **Debt-to-GDP ratio** | **~123%** | Calculated |
| **Annual deficit** | ~$1.82 trillion (~5.8% of GDP) | FRED FYFSGDA188S |
| **Annual revenue** | ~$5.35 trillion (~17.0% of GDP) | FRED FYFRGDA188S |
| **Annual spending** | ~$7.17 trillion (~22.8% of GDP) | Calculated |
| **Annual interest on debt** | ~$1.05 trillion (3.15% of GDP) | FRED FYOIGDA188S |
| **Average interest rate on debt** | 3.32% | Treasury avg_interest_rates |
| **Population over 65** | 17.9% (and rising fast) | FRED SPPOP65UPTOZSUSA |

**In plain English:** The government spends about $7.2 trillion per year but only collects about $5.4 trillion. The $1.8 trillion gap gets added to the debt every year. The interest alone on that debt now costs over $1 trillion — more than the entire defense budget. And it's getting worse because the population is aging, which means more retirees collecting Social Security and Medicare and fewer workers paying taxes.

**The scale of the problem:** To merely *balance* the budget (not pay down debt, just stop adding to it), the government needs to close a **$1.8 trillion annual gap**. For context, the entire Department of Defense budget is $501 billion and total discretionary spending is ~$2.5 trillion. Closing a $1.8T gap through spending cuts alone would require eliminating roughly 72% of all discretionary programs — or increasing revenue by 34%.

## Where the Money Comes From

Federal revenue in FY 2025 is approximately **$5.35 trillion** (17.0% of GDP).

The U.S. collects *less* tax revenue relative to GDP than almost every other wealthy nation:

| Country | Tax Revenue (% of GDP) | Source |
|---------|----------------------|--------|
| **United Kingdom** | **27.0%** | World Bank GC.TAX.TOTL.GD.ZS (2024) |
| **France** | **23.1%** | World Bank (2023) |
| **Canada** | **14.2%** | World Bank (2024) |
| **Germany** | **10.6%** | World Bank (2023)* |
| **United States** | **10.9%** | World Bank (2024) |

\* World Bank "tax revenue" captures only central government taxes and excludes social contributions, which are large in Germany and France. The OECD total tax burden (including state/local and social insurance) is: France ~47%, Germany ~39%, UK ~35%, Canada ~33%, **US ~27%** of GDP. The US is the lowest-taxed major economy by a significant margin.

## Where the Money Goes

The top federal spending categories (FY 2025, from USAspending):

| Category | Amount | % of Total |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Health & Human Services** (Medicare, Medicaid, ACA) | $2.02T | **28%** |
| **Social Security** | $1.63T | **23%** |
| **Interest on the Debt** | ~$1.05T | **15%** |
| **Defense** | $501B | 7% |
| **Veterans Affairs** | $288B | 4% |
| **Agriculture** (incl. food stamps/SNAP) | $185B | 3% |
| **Transportation** | $135B | 2% |
| **Education** | $96B | 1% |
| **Energy** | $81B | 1% |
| Everything else | ~$840B | 16% |
| **Total** | **~$7.17T** | **100%** |

**The math is brutal.** HHS + Social Security + Interest = **$4.7 trillion** — that's **66% of all spending** and it's almost entirely on autopilot. These are "mandatory" programs that pay out based on eligibility formulas, not annual budgets. Congress doesn't vote on them every year. They just grow.

Defense + VA + everything else = **$2.5 trillion** — that's the "discretionary" budget that Congress actually controls. Even if you eliminated *every dollar* of discretionary spending (closing every military base, firing every federal employee, shutting down the FBI, FAA, IRS, national parks, and courts), you'd *still* have a deficit because mandatory spending + interest exceeds total revenue.

**This is the fundamental reason the deficit is so hard to fix: the biggest line items are politically untouchable.**

## Why This Is Hard

### The Demographic Time Bomb

| Year | Population Over 65 (%) | Source |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| 2020 | 16.1% | FRED SPPOP65UPTOZSUSA |
| 2021 | 16.5% | FRED |
| 2022 | 16.9% | FRED |
| 2023 | 17.4% | FRED |
| 2024 | **17.9%** | FRED |
| 2030 (projected) | ~21% | Census projections |

Every year, ~4 million Americans turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare and Social Security. This will continue accelerating through the mid-2030s as the baby boom generation (born 1946–1964) fully retires. **This is not a policy choice — it's demographics.** No president caused it, and no policy can reverse it.

### The Interest Trap

When interest rates were near zero (2009–2021), the government could borrow cheaply. A $28 trillion debt at 1.5% average interest costs ~$420 billion/year. But now rates are 3.32% and the debt is $38.8 trillion, so interest costs **$1.05 trillion/year** — and rising. Every new dollar of debt now costs more to service than the last. This is the definition of a compounding problem.

| FY | Interest as % of GDP | Source |
|----|---------------------|--------|
| 2016 | 1.28% | FRED FYOIGDA188S |
| 2018 | 1.57% | FRED |
| 2020 | 1.62% | FRED |
| 2022 | 1.83% | FRED |
| 2024 | 3.01% | FRED |
| **2025** | **3.15%** | **FRED** |

Interest costs as a share of GDP have nearly **tripled** since 2016. At this rate, interest alone will consume 4%+ of GDP by 2030 — more than we spend on defense, education, transportation, and science *combined*.

---

## The Democratic Plan: Tax More, Invest More, Grow More

This represents the *best version* of the Democratic approach — not any single bill, but the strongest fiscally coherent plan drawing from proposals by economists like Jason Furman, scored by the CBO, and reflected in legislation from Democrats like the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden budget proposals, and Warren/Sanders tax plans.

### Democratic Revenue Side

The core philosophy: **the government has a revenue problem, not just a spending problem.** The US collects 17% of GDP in revenue but spends 23%, and every peer nation collects more revenue.

| Proposal | Estimated Annual Revenue | How It Works |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Let 2017 TCJA expire for incomes >$400K** | +$200–300B/yr | Top rate returns to 39.6%, corporate rate increases from 21% to 28% |
| **Tax capital gains as ordinary income** (for >$1M earners) | +$150–200B/yr | Billionaires currently pay ~20% effective rate; this would close the gap with wage earners |
| **Corporate minimum tax (15% on book income)** | +$50–80B/yr | Already partially enacted via IRA (2022); ensures profitable companies can't pay $0 |
| **Wealth tax or billionaire minimum income tax** | +$50–100B/yr | Proposed: 25% minimum tax on unrealized gains for those with $100M+ (the "Billionaire Minimum Income Tax") |
| **Close carried interest loophole** | +$15–20B/yr | Hedge fund managers currently pay capital gains rates (20%) instead of income rates (37%) on their compensation |
| **Increase IRS enforcement funding** | +$100–200B/yr | Every $1 spent on IRS enforcement returns $5–12 in recovered unpaid taxes. The "tax gap" (taxes owed but not paid) is estimated at $600B+/year |
| **Total additional revenue** | **~$600B–$1T/yr** | |

> **Correlation note:** When Clinton raised the top rate to 39.6% in 1993, federal revenue rose from 17.5% to 19.8% of GDP by 2000 — the highest since WWII. GDP grew 55.6% during the same period, the strongest of any modern president. This doesn't prove causation (the dot-com boom drove much of the revenue), but it does disprove the prediction that higher taxes inevitably kill growth. *(Source: FRED FYFRGDA188S)*

### Democratic Spending Side

Democrats generally resist *cutting* Social Security and Medicare but support *reforming* healthcare costs:

| Proposal | Estimated Annual Savings | How It Works |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Medicare drug price negotiation** (expand IRA provisions) | +$50–100B/yr | Government negotiates drug prices like every other country does. Already started with 10 drugs under IRA. |
| **Public option / Medicare buy-in** | +$50–80B/yr long-term | Increases competition, reduces provider pricing power. Savings are slow to materialize. |
| **Reduce defense spending to 2.5% of GDP** (from 3.4%) | +$250–300B/yr | Still more than any other nation. UK spends 2.3%, France 2.1%. Would require significant strategic restructuring. |
| **Total spending reduction** | **~$350–$500B/yr** | |

> **Correlation note:** The US spends 16.7% of GDP on healthcare — 50% more than any other wealthy nation (Germany 12.3%, France 11.5%, UK 11.1%, Canada 11.3%). But Americans don't live longer — US life expectancy (78.4 years) is *lower* than all of those countries. We're paying more and getting less. This suggests there's significant waste/inefficiency in the system that could theoretically be captured. *(Source: World Bank SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS, CDC life expectancy)*
>
> **Correlation note:** US military spending is 3.4% of GDP — more than the next 7–10 countries combined. The UK (2.3%), France (2.1%), Germany (1.9%), Canada (1.3%), and Japan (1.4%) are all well under the NATO 2% target that the US already far exceeds. *(Source: World Bank MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS)*

### Democratic Legislative Track Record

What has this approach actually produced when Democrats had the votes? A look at the real legislation:

**Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Clinton)** — The gold standard for the Democratic revenue approach. Raised the top income tax rate from 31% to 39.6%, increased the corporate rate, expanded the EITC. Passed with **zero Republican votes** — 218-216 in the House (2-vote margin) and 51-50 in the Senate (VP tiebreaker). Every single Republican in Congress predicted economic catastrophe. What actually happened: the economy boomed, 22.7 million jobs were created, and the budget went from a 3.7% deficit to a 2.3% surplus within 7 years. Revenue rose from 17.5% to 19.8% of GDP. This is the single strongest piece of evidence for the Democratic case.

> **But the asterisk:** The dot-com bubble drove much of the revenue surge through capital gains taxes. When it popped, revenue cratered from 19.8% (2000) to 16.1% (2004) — showing how dependent the surplus was on a market bubble that no tax policy created.

**Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (Biden)** — The most recent Democratic fiscal legislation. Passed **50-50 with VP Harris** breaking the tie, zero Republican votes. Included: 15% corporate minimum tax on book income, Medicare drug price negotiation for 10 drugs, $80B in IRS enforcement funding, clean energy tax credits. CBO scored it as reducing the deficit by ~$237B over 10 years — meaningful but modest relative to the $1.8T annual deficit. Corporate profits were running at **$3.6 trillion/year** (FRED CP, Q3 2025) at the time, yet corporate tax receipts as a share of GDP were just 1.6% — the lowest since the 1940s.

> **Correlation note:** After the IRA's corporate minimum tax took effect, corporate tax receipts ticked up slightly but remained historically low. The 15% minimum tax generated ~$25B/yr in its first years — far less than the $50-80B projected, because companies restructured to minimize book income. This illustrates the behavioral response problem. *(Source: FRED FGRECPT — federal receipts, Q3 2025: $5.77T annualized)*

**American Rescue Plan of 2021 (Biden)** — $1.9 trillion in COVID relief, passed 220-211 in the House and 50-49 in the Senate, **zero Republican votes**. This is the counter-example for the Democratic approach — a massive spending bill that contributed significantly to the inflation crisis. CPI rose 21.3% over Biden's term. Many economists (including Democratic-aligned Larry Summers) warned in early 2021 that $1.9T was too much stimulus for an economy already recovering. The ARP is Exhibit A for why "just spend more" doesn't always work.

**The Build Back Better Act (2021) — The One That Died:** Biden's original $3.5 trillion spending plan would have included universal pre-K, Medicare expansion, climate spending, and paid family leave — all funded by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. **It was killed by Democratic Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia**, who argued it was too expensive and inflationary. The IRA was the $400B remnant that Manchin eventually agreed to. This shows the internal fiscal tension within the Democratic party — not all Democrats support unlimited revenue-and-spend.

> **The PhRMA lobbying connection:** The pharmaceutical industry (PhRMA) has filed **2,282 lobbying registrations** covering healthcare issues over the past 25 years (Source: Senate Lobbying Disclosures, LDA). Democratic drug pricing proposals have been fought tooth and nail by this industry, which spends more on lobbying than any other sector. The IRA's drug negotiation was limited to just 10 drugs precisely because of this lobbying pressure — a compromise that reduced the bill's deficit reduction significantly from what full negotiation would have achieved.

### Democratic Math

| Component | Annual Impact |
|-----------|--------------|
| Additional revenue | +$600B to +$1.0T |
| Spending reductions | +$350B to +$500B |
| **Total deficit reduction** | **$950B to $1.5T/yr** |
| Current deficit | ~$1.82T |
| **Remaining deficit** | **$320B to $870B** |

At the midpoint, this would reduce the deficit by roughly **$1.2 trillion** — from $1.82T to ~$620B, or from 5.8% of GDP to ~2.0%. That's not a surplus, but it would stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio (because 2% deficit with 3%+ GDP growth means debt grows slower than the economy).

### Democratic Good Things

1. **Doesn't touch Social Security or Medicare benefits** — the most popular government programs, relied on by 70+ million Americans
2. **Progressive** — burden falls on highest earners and corporations, not middle class
3. **IRS enforcement has a strong return on investment** — closing the tax gap costs $1 and returns $5–12 in recovered unpaid taxes. The "tax gap" (taxes owed but not paid) is estimated at $600B+/year, and enforcement funding has bipartisan economic support even though it faces political opposition
4. **Healthcare cost reduction potentially helps *everyone*** — lower drug prices, more competition, lower premiums
5. **Has been partially tested** — Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy and the economy boomed. The IRA's drug negotiation is already reducing costs.
6. **International evidence supports it** — every comparable nation collects more revenue and has lower deficits

### Democratic Caveats and Problems

1. **Capital gains realization problem:** If you tax unrealized gains, you force people to sell assets to pay tax — potentially triggering market crashes. The Billionaire Minimum Income Tax is theoretically elegant but practically nightmarish to implement.
2. **Corporate inversions:** If the corporate rate goes to 28%, companies will move headquarters overseas or shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions. This happened extensively before the 2017 cuts. A global minimum tax (OECD Pillar 2, 15%) helps but isn't fully enforced.
3. **Defense cuts require strategic discipline:** Cutting defense by ~$250B means closing bases, canceling weapons programs, and reducing force size. In a world with Ukraine, Taiwan, and Middle East tensions, the security argument against this is real.
4. **Revenue estimates are always optimistic.** The CBO and JCT regularly overestimate how much new taxes will collect because taxpayers change behavior. Capital gains taxes especially — people simply *don't sell* if the tax is too high.
5. **"Tax the rich" has limits.** The top 1% already pays ~42% of all federal income tax. At some point, higher rates produce less revenue (Laffer curve). Where that point is remains fiercely debated.
6. **Doesn't solve the long-term entitlement math.** Social Security's trust fund is projected to run out in ~2033. Medicare Part A in ~2031. This plan doesn't address that structural problem — it just reduces the near-term deficit.
7. **Political feasibility: near zero.** Would require 60 Senate votes or reconciliation, and even moderate Democrats have balked at wealth taxes and defense cuts.

### Democratic Grade

**Fiscal realism: B+** — The math is directionally sound and the revenue estimates are grounded in CBO scoring. But the upper bounds are optimistic and behavioral responses will reduce actual collections.

**Political realism: D** — Almost none of this can pass in the current Congress. Even during unified Democratic control (2021–2023), Build Back Better ($3.5T) was killed by one Democratic senator.

**Structural fix: C+** — Reduces the deficit substantially but doesn't address the demographic time bomb (aging population) or the structural design of entitlements.

---

## The Republican Plan: Spend Less, Tax Less, Grow More

This represents the *best version* of the Republican approach — drawing from the most fiscally coherent proposals by economists like John Cochrane, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Heritage Foundation budget proposals, and reflected in legislation like the RSC budgets and Trump-era deregulation.

### Republican Revenue Side

The core philosophy: **lower tax rates encourage growth, and growth generates more revenue.** Don't take a bigger slice of the pie — grow the pie.

| Proposal | Estimated Revenue Impact | How It Works |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Make 2017 TCJA permanent** | -$300–400B/yr (static) | Keeps current individual and business rates. Revenue cost offset (partially) by growth. |
| **Further corporate rate cut** (21% → 15%) | -$100–200B/yr (static) | Makes US most competitive in the world for business investment |
| **Deregulation growth dividend** | +$100–300B/yr (dynamic) | Less regulation = more business formation = more employment = more tax revenue. Hard to score. |
| **Tariff revenue** | +$50–100B/yr | Tariffs are a tax on imports. Currently generating significant revenue, but this is a consumption tax that falls on American buyers. |
| **Net revenue impact** | **-$250B to +$0/yr** | Revenue is flat-to-negative. The plan depends on spending cuts and growth. |

> **Correlation note:** After the 2017 TCJA, federal revenue *as a share of GDP* fell from 16.9% (2017) to 16.1% (2018) — the largest single-year drop outside of recessions. It has since recovered to 17.0% (2025), but that's partly due to inflation pushing people into higher brackets. The promised revenue surge from faster growth did not fully materialize — growth ran about 2.5-3% vs the claimed 4-6%. Revenue in dollars increased, but slower than spending. *(Source: FRED FYFRGDA188S)*
>
> **Correlation note:** However, after the 2017 corporate tax cut, business investment *did* increase in 2018 (+6.4%), and the unemployment rate fell to 3.5% by 2019 — a 50-year low. So the tax cuts had real economic effects, just not enough to pay for themselves. *(Source: FRED UNRATE)*

### Republican Spending Side

This is where the Republican plan has more teeth. The philosophy: **government is too big and wastes too much money.**

| Proposal | Estimated Annual Savings | How It Works |
|----------|------------------------|-------------|
| **Cap federal spending growth at CPI** (not GDP) | +$200–400B/yr over 10yrs | Currently spending grows 5–8%/year. Capping at inflation (~2.5%) forces agencies to find efficiencies. Savings compound over time. |
| **Raise Social Security retirement age** (67 → 69 over 20 years) | +$50–100B/yr by 2040 | Americans live much longer than when SS was created (65 vs 78+ today). Adjusting the age to reflect longevity. |
| **Medicare premium support** (competitive bidding) | +$100–200B/yr long-term | Instead of open-ended payments, give seniors a fixed-dollar voucher to buy private insurance. Insurers compete on price. |
| **Block-grant Medicaid to states** | +$100–200B/yr | Give states a fixed amount instead of open-ended matching. States innovate or cut. |
| **Reduce federal workforce by 10–15%** | +$30–50B/yr | Attrition, consolidation, technology. DOGE-style efficiency (when done with scalpels, not chainsaws). |
| **Eliminate/consolidate agencies** | +$20–50B/yr | Combines overlapping programs. GAO identifies ~$200B in duplicate/wasteful programs annually. |
| **Total spending reduction** | **~$500B–$1.0T/yr** (phased in over 10 years) |

> **Correlation note:** Federal spending as a share of GDP has grown from 20.5% (2016) to 22.8% (2025). If spending had merely grown at the rate of inflation since 2016, total outlays would be about $1.2T/year lower than they are today. There is clearly room to reduce growth rates — the question is *which* spending to cut.
>
> **Correlation note:** The Congressional GAO identifies $200+ billion annually in overlapping, duplicative, or fragmented federal programs (per their annual report to Congress). This is real, documented waste — not a political talking point.
>
> **Correlation note:** Social Security was designed in 1935 when life expectancy was 61. The retirement age was set at 65 — *above* life expectancy, meaning most people were expected to die before collecting. Today life expectancy is 78.4 and the retirement age is 67. The system is structurally mismatched to modern demographics. *(Source: CDC life expectancy, Social Security Administration history)*

### Republican Legislative Track Record

What has this approach actually produced when Republicans had the votes?

**Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Trump I)** — The flagship Republican fiscal bill of the modern era. Cut the corporate rate from 35% to 21% (permanent) and cut individual rates (temporary, expiring 2025). Passed **51-48 in the Senate** with zero Democratic votes, and **224-201 in the House** with zero Democratic votes and 12 Republican defections (from high-tax states hurt by the SALT cap). CBO estimated the bill would add **$1.9 trillion to the debt** over 10 years.

What actually happened to revenue: Federal revenue as a share of GDP fell from **16.9% (2017) to 16.1% (2018)** — an immediate $150B+ annual revenue loss. Revenue eventually recovered to 17.0% by 2025, but only because inflation pushed workers into higher brackets (bracket creep), not because of magical growth. The tax cut did not "pay for itself" — this is settled fact, confirmed by CBO, JCT, and Treasury data.

> **The corporate profit paradox:** After the TCJA, corporate profits rose from ~$2.3T/yr (2017) to **$3.6T/yr (2025)** — a 57% increase. But corporate tax receipts barely grew in absolute terms and *fell* as a share of GDP. Companies used the tax savings for stock buybacks ($1 trillion in 2018 alone — a record), not investment or hiring. The Tax Foundation estimated only 20–25% of the corporate tax cut flowed to workers through wages; the rest went to shareholders. *(Source: FRED CP — corporate profits)*

**Budget Control Act of 2011 (Obama + Republican House)** — Often forgotten, but this was the most consequential Republican spending restraint bill of the modern era. After the 2011 debt ceiling crisis (Republicans threatened to let the government default), the BCA imposed **automatic spending cuts (sequestration)** if a bipartisan "supercommittee" couldn't agree on deficit reduction. The committee failed, and sequestration kicked in — cutting ~$85B/year from both defense and non-defense discretionary spending from 2013–2021. This was crude (across-the-board, not targeted) but effective: the deficit fell from 8.3% to 2.4% of GDP between 2012 and 2015.

> **Correlation note:** The 2013-2015 deficit reduction is the only major modern example of the Republican spending-cap approach actually working. But it happened under a Democratic president (Obama) with a Republican House — divided government forcing discipline. When Republicans had unified control (2017-2019), they *increased* the deficit by passing $1.9T in tax cuts and lifting the sequester caps. The pattern: Republicans cut spending when they're in opposition, and cut taxes when they're in power. *(Source: FRED FYFSGDA188S)*

**The "Contract with America" (1995, Gingrich)** — When Newt Gingrich's Republicans took the House in 1994, they passed a sweeping fiscal agenda: balanced budget amendment (fell one vote short in the Senate), spending caps, welfare reform, and eventually the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This led to the only surplus in 55 years. But again — it happened in divided government with Clinton, not under unified Republican control.

**The Ryan Budgets (2012-2014)** — House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan proposed the most detailed Republican deficit reduction plans in modern history: convert Medicare to premium support, block-grant Medicaid, lower tax rates while broadening the base, and cap discretionary spending. The Republican House passed these budgets multiple times. The Senate never took them up. These remain the most intellectually honest Republican fiscal documents — and they were never signed into law precisely because the spending cuts (especially to Medicare) were politically toxic.

**DOGE and the Current Approach (2025-present)** — The Department of Government Efficiency under Elon Musk represents the most aggressive government-reduction push in modern history. The approach targets waste, redundancy, and excess federal employment. Early results have been mixed: some genuine savings identified (duplicate IT systems, unused office leases), but also significant controversy over cutting programs with broad public support. The debt has grown by $2.55T in 13 months — suggesting that whatever DOGE has saved is being offset by other spending and the continuing structural deficit.

> **The honest Republican problem:** Republicans have controlled the House, Senate, and Presidency simultaneously for 6 of the last 26 years (2003-2007, 2017-2019). In *every* instance, they increased the deficit — through tax cuts (2001, 2003, 2017) and spending (wars, Medicare Part D, COVID). The Republican Party has an excellent *theory* of fiscal discipline but a poor *practice* of it when given power. The only Republican spending restraint that actually reduced deficits came during divided government.

> **The honest Democratic problem:** Democrats have also controlled the House, Senate, and Presidency simultaneously for 6 of the last 26 years (2009-2011, 2021-2023). In both instances, they also increased the deficit — through the $831B stimulus (ARRA, 2009) and the $1.9T American Rescue Plan (2021). While both were crisis responses with arguable justification, the pattern is identical: when either party has unified control, they spend without restraint. Democrats claim fiscal responsibility through revenue increases, but their spending proposals consistently outpace those revenue gains. Build Back Better ($3.5T), had it passed, would have been the largest spending increase in American history. The Democratic Party's revenue proposals are real, but so is their appetite for new programs that consume every dollar raised and then some.

### Republican Math

| Component | Annual Impact |
|-----------|--------------|
| Revenue changes | -$250B to +$0 |
| Spending reductions | +$500B to +$1.0T (fully phased in) |
| Growth dividend (optimistic) | +$100B to +$300B |
| **Total deficit reduction** | **$350B to $1.3T/yr** |
| Current deficit | ~$1.82T |
| **Remaining deficit** | **$520B to $1.47T** |

At the midpoint, this would reduce the deficit by roughly **$750 billion** — from $1.82T to ~$1.07T, or from 5.8% of GDP to ~3.4%. Better, but still running a significant annual deficit.

The math only reaches balance if *both* the optimistic growth assumptions *and* the aggressive spending cuts are fully implemented — a combination that has never occurred in American history.

### Republican Good Things

1. **Addresses the entitlement problem directly** — raising the retirement age and reforming Medicare are the only long-term structural fixes for the demographic time bomb
2. **Competitive tax rates attract business investment** — the 2017 corporate tax cut did measurably increase investment and hiring
3. **Spending caps actually work** — the 1990s balanced budgets were achieved partly through spending caps (Budget Enforcement Act 1990, Balanced Budget Act 1997), negotiated by a Republican Congress and Democratic president
4. **Deregulation has measurable benefits** — the Trump I era saw business confidence indices surge, and the pre-COVID economy was genuinely strong
5. **GAO waste is real and documented** — this isn't rhetoric; there are hundreds of billions in identified inefficiencies
6. **Forces hard choices** — unlike the Democratic Plan, this approach confronts the structural design of entitlements rather than just treating symptoms with more revenue

### Republican Caveats and Problems

1. **Tax cuts don't pay for themselves.** This has been tested multiple times (Reagan 1981, Bush 2001/2003, Trump 2017). Revenue *always* falls below projections in the first 5–10 years. The Laffer curve is real but the US is almost certainly on the left side of it (where cuts reduce revenue, not increase it). Revenue/GDP fell from 19.8% (2000) to 16.1% (2018) during/after major tax cuts.
2. **Cutting Social Security and Medicare is electoral suicide.** Seniors vote at the highest rates of any demographic. Every Republican who has proposed entitlement reform has faced brutal attack ads. This is why it's never actually been done despite 40 years of proposals.
3. **Block-granting Medicaid means coverage cuts.** When states get fixed dollars, they cut eligibility. This has been well-documented in states that have received waivers. The people most affected are the poorest and sickest.
4. **Premium support for Medicare shifts costs to seniors.** If the voucher doesn't keep pace with healthcare inflation (which runs 2–3x general inflation), the effective benefit shrinks over time and elderly Americans pay more out of pocket.
5. **The "growth dividend" is speculative.** Every plan that relies on assumed higher growth is making a bet that may not pay off. The CBO's baseline assumes ~2% real growth. Claiming 3–4% requires explaining *why* your policies will outperform the baseline.
6. **Federal workforce cuts have limits.** Many federal employees do things that can't be eliminated — air traffic controllers, border agents, food inspectors, military personnel. The "bloated bureaucracy" narrative has real elements but also real limits.
7. **DOGE-style cuts risk destroying institutional capacity.** Firing randomly or eliminating agencies without understanding what they do creates downstream costs (safety failures, fraud increases, service degradation) that don't show up in budget savings for years.

### Republican Grade

**Fiscal realism: B−** — The spending cuts are structurally sound but the revenue side is the weak link. You can't cut your way to balance when revenue is already at historical lows relative to GDP. The growth assumptions are optimistic.

**Political realism: D+** — Entitlement reform is the third rail of American politics. The party that touches Social Security loses the next election. This has been true since the 1980s.

**Structural fix: B+** — This is the plan's strongest feature. It actually addresses the demographic problem (aging population, entitlement design) that the Democratic Plan ignores.

## What Actually Worked Before: The Historical Evidence

The United States has balanced the budget exactly **once** in the past 55 years — during the Clinton presidency (1998–2001). What actually happened?

**It was both plans working together.** Specifically:

| Policy | Party | Impact |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Tax increase on wealthy (1993 OBRA) | **Democratic** (0 R votes) | Revenue rose from 17.5% to 19.8% of GDP |
| Spending caps (1990 BEA, 1997 BBA) | **Bipartisan** (R Congress + D President) | Spending held below 19% of GDP |
| Welfare reform (1996) | **Bipartisan** (R Congress + D President) | Reduced transfer payments |
| Dot-com boom | **Neither** (market-driven) | Capital gains revenue exploded |
| Peace dividend | **Neither** (end of Cold War) | Defense spending fell from 4.5% to 3.0% of GDP |
| Low interest rates | **Fed** (Greenspan) | Debt service costs stayed manageable |

**The surplus required ALL of these things simultaneously.** Higher taxes *and* spending restraint *and* economic luck *and* low defense costs *and* favorable demographics (boomers at peak earning age). Remove any one ingredient and the surplus disappears.

> **Correlation note:** Revenue was 19.8% of GDP during the surplus years. Today it's 17.0%. If revenue were still at 19.8%, the government would collect an additional ~$880 billion per year — enough to more than halve the deficit without any spending cuts. The revenue shortfall since the Bush/Trump tax cuts accounts for a large share of the debt increase. *(Source: FRED FYFRGDA188S)*
>
> **Correlation note:** Spending was 17.5% of GDP during the surplus years. Today it's 22.8%. If spending were still at 17.5%, the government would spend $1.67 trillion less — enough to run a surplus even at current revenue levels. The spending increase since 2000 accounts for the rest of the debt increase. *(Source: calculated from FRED GDP, FYFRGDA188S, FYFSGDA188S)*

**The honest reading:** both sides are right, and both sides are hiding the ball. Revenue *is* too low by historical standards (the Democratic argument). Spending *has* grown too fast (the Republican argument). Fixing one without the other doesn't close the gap.

---

## The Uncomfortable Truths Neither Party Will Say

### 1. The Interest Trap Is Already Sprung

Interest on the debt is now **$1.05 trillion per year** — 15% of all spending and growing. Even if we balanced the budget *tomorrow*, we'd still owe $38.8 trillion and the interest keeps compounding. At 3.32% average rate on $38.8T, interest costs $1.29T annually. The only way to reduce this is to either (a) pay down the principal (requires sustained surplus — hasn't happened in 25 years), (b) get interest rates back to near-zero (requires another crisis), or (c) inflate the debt away (erodes everyone's savings).

### 2. Medicare Is the Real Problem, Not Social Security

Social Security is fixable — raise the retirement age, lift the FICA cap, or means-test benefits. It's a solvable math problem. Medicare is the fiscal black hole because **healthcare costs grow faster than GDP, and the US system is uniquely expensive:**

| Country | Health Spending (% of GDP) | Life Expectancy | Source |
|---------|--------------------------|-----------------|--------|
| **United States** | **16.7%** | **78.4 years** | World Bank SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS |
| Germany | 12.3% | 81.7 years | World Bank |
| France | 11.5% | 82.5 years | World Bank |
| Canada | 11.3% | 81.3 years | World Bank |
| UK | 11.1% | 81.8 years | World Bank |
| Japan | 10.7% | 84.8 years | World Bank |

The US spends **60% more** on healthcare than the next most expensive country (Germany) and has **worse outcomes** (lower life expectancy). If we spent at German levels, we'd save ~$1.4 trillion per year — almost exactly the deficit. **The deficit is, to a significant degree, a healthcare cost problem disguised as a fiscal problem.**

### 3. Growing Our Way Out Is a Fantasy at Current Debt Levels

Both parties claim growth will solve everything. The math says otherwise:

- Current deficit: ~5.8% of GDP
- Current real GDP growth: ~2.5%
- To stabilize debt-to-GDP, you need: deficit < (GDP growth × debt-to-GDP ratio)
- 2.5% × 123% = 3.1%

So the deficit needs to be *below 3.1% of GDP* just to stabilize — meaning even in the best case, roughly **$850 billion** in deficit reduction is needed before growth does any work. Neither plan achieves this through growth alone.

### 4. Neither Party Has Balanced a Budget Without the Other

| Balanced/Era | President | Congress | Approach |
|-------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| 1998–2001 | Clinton (D) | **Republican** | Tax hikes + spending caps + boom |
| 1969 | Nixon (R) | **Democratic** | Vietnam surtax + cold war spending |
| 1960 | Eisenhower (R) | **Democratic** | High taxes + restrained spending |

Every balanced budget in modern history required **divided government**. Unified control — of either party — has always produced larger deficits because there's no counterweight to the majority's spending/tax-cut preferences.

### 5. Voters Don't Actually Want What They Say They Want

Polls consistently show Americans want:
- No cuts to Social Security ✓
- No cuts to Medicare ✓
- No cuts to defense ✓  
- No tax increases ✓
- A balanced budget ✓

**You cannot have all five.** The first four make the fifth impossible. Until voters accept that someone, somewhere, has to pay or receive less, the deficit will continue growing under any president of any party.

---

## The Nuclear Option: Single-Payer Healthcare and the Deficit

Neither the Democratic nor Republican plan above addresses the single largest structural driver of the deficit: **the United States spends more on healthcare than any nation on Earth, by a staggering margin, and gets worse results.** A single-payer (or universal) healthcare system wouldn't just be a healthcare reform — it might be the single most effective deficit reduction policy available, if the international data is to be believed.

### The Data: America's Healthcare Spending Is an Extreme Outlier

| Country | Spending Per Capita (2023) | Life Expectancy (2023) | System Type |
|---------|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------|
| **United States** | **$13,473** | **78.4 years** | **Mixed private/public** |
| Germany | $6,395 | 80.5 years | Multi-payer universal (Bismarck) |
| Canada | $6,187 | 81.6 years | Single-payer (Medicare for All) |
| France | $5,149 | 82.9 years | Multi-payer universal |
| United Kingdom | $5,407 | 81.2 years | Single-payer (NHS) |
| Japan | $3,638 | 84.0 years | Universal multi-payer |

*Source: World Bank SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD (2023), SP.DYN.LE00.IN (2023)*

**The US spends 2x more per person than the average of comparable nations — and Americans die younger.** This is not a small gap. At $13,473 per person vs. an average of ~$5,300 for the other five nations, the US overspends by roughly **$8,100 per person per year.**

The CDC's own mortality data confirms the problem isn't just life expectancy. The US age-adjusted death rate in 2025 Q1 is **723.4 per 100,000** — and it varies dramatically by state. Mississippi (975.7), West Virginia (959.0), and Oklahoma (946.5) have death rates 50%+ higher than New York (591.9), Hawaii (568.7), and New Jersey (608.5). States with higher poverty rates, lower insurance coverage, and less access to care have significantly worse outcomes — a pattern that universal systems in peer nations largely eliminate.

> **Correlation note:** The 10 states with the *highest* death rates (MS, WV, KY, OK, TN, AL, AR, IN, MO, SC) all have median household incomes below $68,000. The 10 states with the *lowest* death rates (HI, NY, NJ, CA, MA, FL, CT, RI, CO, DC) overwhelmingly have higher incomes and more expansive Medicaid coverage. This is a health-income-coverage correlation — it shows that access to care and income level directly affect survival, regardless of other state-level factors. *(Source: CDC quarterly mortality rates Q1 2025, Census ACS 2023 median income)*

With ~335 million Americans (Census ACS 2023), that's approximately **$2.7 trillion in excess healthcare spending annually** compared to what peer nations achieve with universal coverage and better outcomes.

### Where Does the Excess Go?

The answer isn't that Americans get more healthcare. It's that they pay more for the same things:

**1. Administrative overhead:** The US healthcare system has ~1,000 private insurance companies, each with their own billing codes, claims processes, denial systems, and profit margins. Estimates of administrative waste range from **$600B to $1T per year.** Medicare's administrative costs are ~2% of spending. Private insurers average 12-18%. A single-payer system eliminates the entire private insurance administrative layer.

**2. Drug prices:** Americans pay 2-3x more for the same prescription drugs as Canadians, British, or Germans — because those countries negotiate prices through their universal systems. The IRA started negotiating prices for 10 drugs. A universal system would negotiate *all* of them.

**3. Provider pricing power:** In the US, hospitals and specialist physicians set prices without significant negotiation. In universal systems, the government (as the single large buyer) negotiates rates with providers — just as Medicare already does, but the rates would apply to everyone.

| Component | US Private Insurance | Universal Systems | Difference |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Admin overhead | 12–18% of premiums | 2–5% | $600B–$1T wasted |
| Drug prices | $1,500/yr average per capita | $600–800/yr | $250–$300B excess |
| Hospital prices | 2.5x Medicare rates | Near Medicare rates | $300–600B excess |
| Physician prices | Highest in world | 30–50% lower | $200–300B excess |

### The Government Already Pays Most of the Bill

This is the part most Americans don't realize. The US government **already spends 9.0% of GDP** on healthcare (FRED FYFRGDA188S components; World Bank SH.XPD.GHED.GD.ZS). That's roughly the same as the UK (9.0%), more than France (7.8%), and close to Germany (9.3%) — countries that cover *everyone*.

**The US government spends as much public money on healthcare as countries with universal coverage — and then Americans pay another $6,200 per person privately on top of that.**

| Country | Government Health Spending (% GDP) | Private Health Spending Per Capita | Coverage |
|---------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| **United States** | **9.0%** | **$6,204** | 91% (8% uninsured) |
| United Kingdom | 9.0% | $985 | **100%** |
| Germany | 9.3% | $1,335 | **100%** |
| Canada | 7.9% | $1,901 | **100%** |
| France | 7.8% | $1,662 | **100%** |
| Japan | 9.1% | $552 | **100%** |

*Source: World Bank SH.XPD.GHED.GD.ZS (2023), SH.XPD.PVTD.PC.CD (2023)*

The US government already pays enough in public health dollars to cover everyone — other countries prove this. The $6,204 per capita in *private* spending is the excess that a universal system could theoretically eliminate or dramatically reduce.

### The Deficit Math

If the US transitioned to a universal system and achieved spending levels comparable to, say, **Canada** (not even the cheapest — Japan spends half what we do):

| Scenario | Per Capita Cost | Total Cost (335M people) | Current Total | Savings |
|----------|----------------|------------------------|---------------|---------|
| Current US system | $13,473 | ~$4.51T | $4.51T | — |
| Canadian-level spending | $6,187 | ~$2.07T | — | **~$2.44T** |
| German-level spending | $6,395 | ~$2.14T | — | **~$2.37T** |
| UK-level spending | $5,407 | ~$1.81T | — | **~$2.70T** |
| Average of peer nations | ~$5,300 | ~$1.78T | — | **~$2.73T** |

Even the *conservative* scenario (matching Canada, the most expensive universal system) saves **$2.4 trillion per year** — more than the entire current deficit of $1.82 trillion. **A single policy change could theoretically not just close the deficit but create a surplus.**

Of course, reality is messier than the math. But the order of magnitude is correct: if America spent what other rich countries spend on healthcare, the deficit problem would be solved as a side effect.

### Which Party Does This Belong To?

**It's complicated.** Single-payer is associated with progressive Democrats (Bernie Sanders' "Medicare for All" bill), but the concept cuts across traditional lines:

| Argument | Party it Helps |
|----------|---------------|
| Saves $2T+ per year in total spending | **Both** — fiscal hawks should love this |
| Eliminates private insurance industry | **Against Republican** free-market principles |
| Government controls all healthcare pricing | **Against Republican** limited-government ideology |
| Reduces the deficit without raising taxes | **Fits Republican** fiscal talking points |
| Covers all Americans | **Fits Democratic** equality/access goals |
| Businesses no longer bear insurance costs | **Fits Republican** pro-business goals |
| Funded by taxes instead of premiums | **Fits Democratic** redistribution approach |
| Every other capitalist democracy does it | **Neither** wants to acknowledge |

> **The political paradox:** Single-payer would save businesses ~$900B/year in employer-sponsored insurance costs. It would make American manufacturers more competitive globally (Toyota doesn't pay health insurance for Japanese workers — that cost is in Japan's universal system). Small businesses, which lean Republican, are disproportionately crushed by health insurance costs. And yet the Republican Party opposes it because of its anti-government philosophy, and much of the Democratic establishment opposes it because the private insurance industry (which employs 2.7 million people and donates heavily to both parties) is a powerful lobbying force.

### Why It Hasn't Happened — The Honest Obstacles

1. **The insurance industry employs 2.7 million people.** Eliminating private insurance means those jobs disappear. The transition cost is enormous, even if the long-term savings are larger. No politician wants to be responsible for firing 2.7 million people.

2. **Lobbying is extraordinary.** Health insurance and pharmaceutical companies consistently spend more on lobbying and campaign contributions than any other industry. PhRMA alone has 2,282 lobbying registrations on file (Source: Senate LDA). The American Hospital Association, insurance companies, and device manufacturers add hundreds of millions more. Both parties receive this money.

3. **Transition takes years and is chaotic.** Canada took 10 years to fully implement its system (1957-1966). Taiwan did it in 2 years. The UK built the NHS from scratch after WWII. Any transition would be disruptive, and the disruption period (when costs are high but savings haven't materialized) would be politically brutal.

4. **Tax visibility:** Americans currently pay $6,200/person in private healthcare costs (premiums, copays, deductibles) — but they don't *see* it as a tax. Converting this to a visible tax (even if the tax is lower than the premiums it replaces) triggers anti-tax sentiment. Canadians pay ~$4,300/person in health taxes + ~$1,900 privately — total ~$6,200, half of what Americans pay. But the tax part is visible and politically contested.

5. **Provider resistance.** American hospitals and specialist physicians earn 2-3x what their international peers earn. A universal system would negotiate those prices down — meaning lower incomes for doctors and hospital systems. The AMA and hospital associations are powerful political forces.

6. **Constitutional questions.** Whether the federal government can mandate a single-payer system is legally uncertain. States have tried (Vermont attempted it in 2014 and abandoned it due to cost concerns during transition).

7. **The opioid crisis adds hidden costs.** The US drug overdose death rate was 19.8 per 100,000 in 2016 (CDC) — far higher than any peer nation. White males aged 45-54 had a rate of **47.8 per 100,000**. These "deaths of despair" (overdoses, alcoholism, suicide) are uniquely American among wealthy nations and drive healthcare costs, disability claims, and lost productivity. Countries with universal healthcare systems have lower overdose rates partly because addiction treatment is accessible without insurance barriers. *(Source: CDC Drug Overdose Mortality dataset)*

### The Bottom Line on Healthcare and the Deficit

The data is unambiguous: **the US healthcare system is the primary structural driver of the deficit.** HHS spending ($2.02T) is the single largest line item in the federal budget. It's growing faster than GDP, faster than revenue, and faster than any other spending category. And the US pays 2x what peer nations pay for worse outcomes.

If — and this is an enormous political "if" — the US achieved even 75% of the savings that peer nations demonstrate are possible, it would reduce healthcare costs by roughly **$1.8 trillion per year** (split between federal budget savings and private savings). The federal portion alone (~$800B–$1T) would cut the deficit in half.

No other single policy change comes close to this magnitude. Not tax increases. Not spending cuts. Not entitlement reform. Not growth. **The deficit is a healthcare cost problem wearing a fiscal policy disguise.**

> **The honest single-payer problem:** The savings estimates above assume the US could match peer-nation efficiency — but the US has structural disadvantages those nations didn't face when building their systems. Americans are significantly sicker (42% obesity vs 10–25% in peer nations), the existing healthcare infrastructure is built around private profit incentives, and the transition itself would cost trillions before savings materialize. Canada took 10 years to implement their system in the 1960s; doing it in a $4.5 trillion industry with 2.7 million insurance workers and 155 million employer-insured would be orders of magnitude harder. The UK and Canada also face long wait times and underfunding — the NHS has chronic staffing shortages and multi-year waits for elective procedures. No universal system is without significant trade-offs, and the US would almost certainly not capture 100% of the theoretical savings. A more realistic estimate is 40–60% of the gap, which would still be $1–1.6 trillion — transformative but not the full $2.7T.

---

## The Opposite Nuclear Option: Full Free-Market Healthcare

If single-payer is the "government does everything" approach, the opposite is "government gets out entirely." What would happen if the US moved *away* from government healthcare and toward a fully market-driven system? There is actually a real-world model for this — **Singapore** — and the data is surprising.

### The Singapore Model: The Free-Market Success Story

Singapore has the most market-oriented healthcare system among wealthy nations. Its approach:

1. **Mandatory health savings accounts (Medisave):** Every worker deposits 8–10.5% of wages into a personal health savings account. This money is *yours*, not pooled — you use it for your own medical expenses. If you don't use it, you keep it for retirement.
2. **Catastrophic insurance only (MediShield Life):** Universal catastrophic coverage for large bills — paid from Medisave accounts, not taxes. High deductibles, low premiums.
3. **Means-tested government subsidies (Medifund):** The poorest get government help, but everyone else pays directly.
4. **Price transparency and competition:** Hospitals publish prices. Patients shop. Government sets rules but doesn't set prices for most services.
5. **Government owns hospitals but runs them competitively:** Public hospitals compete with private ones on price and quality.

### How Singapore's Numbers Compare

| Metric | United States | Singapore | Source |
|--------|--------------|-----------|--------|
| **Health spending (% GDP)** | **16.7%** | **4.5%** | World Bank SH.XPD.CHEX.GD.ZS |
| **Govt health spending (% GDP)** | **9.0%** | **2.6%** | World Bank SH.XPD.GHED.GD.ZS |
| **Spending per capita** | **$13,473** | **$3,922** | World Bank SH.XPD.CHEX.PC.CD |
| **Life expectancy** | **78.4 years** | **82.9 years** | World Bank SP.DYN.LE00.IN |
| **Out-of-pocket (% of health spending)** | 10.9% | **25.4%** | World Bank SH.XPD.OOPC.CH.ZS |

Singapore spends **less than one-third** of what the US spends on healthcare — both as a share of GDP (4.5% vs 16.7%) and per capita ($3,922 vs $13,473). Its government spends just 2.6% of GDP on health, compared to America's 9.0%. And Singaporeans live **4.5 years longer.**

**The trade-off:** Singaporeans pay 25.4% of health costs out-of-pocket (vs. America's 10.9%). They have more "skin in the game" — which economic theory says creates cost-consciousness. When you're spending your own money from your own savings account, you shop for value.

### What a Singapore-Style US System Would Look Like

| Component | How It Would Work | Estimated Federal Savings |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| **Replace Medicare/Medicaid with mandatory health savings accounts** | Every American deposits 8% of income into a personal HSA. Used for routine care. | -$2.0T+ in federal spending (eliminates HHS spending) |
| **Universal catastrophic insurance** | Federal catastrophic plan covers bills >$10,000. Funded by a small payroll tax. | +$200–400B in new costs |
| **Means-tested subsidy for low-income** | Government funds HSAs for those below 200% poverty line | +$200–300B in subsidy costs |
| **Price transparency mandate** | All hospitals/doctors must publish prices. No surprise billing. | $0 direct cost; reduces prices through competition |
| **Eliminate employer-sponsored insurance tax exclusion** | The $300B/year tax break that ties insurance to employment goes away | +$300B in tax revenue |
| **Net federal impact** | | **-$1.0T to -$1.5T in federal spending** |

### The Deficit Math

If the US adopted Singapore-level government health spending (2.6% of GDP instead of 9.0%):

| Scenario | Govt Health Spending (% GDP) | Dollar Amount | Current | Savings |
|----------|------------------------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| Current US | 9.0% | ~$2.83T | $2.83T | — |
| Singapore-level | 2.6% | ~$0.82T | — | **~$2.01T** |
| Halfway (5.8%) | 5.8% | ~$1.83T | — | **~$1.00T** |

Even the *halfway* scenario saves $1 trillion from the federal budget — enough to bring the deficit from $1.82T to ~$820B.

### Which Party Does This Belong To?

This is **pure Republican** in philosophy — personal responsibility, market competition, small government. It's the opposite of single-payer in every way:

| Feature | Single-Payer | Free-Market (Singapore) |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|
| Who pays | Government (taxes) | Individual (savings accounts) |
| Who controls prices | Government | Market competition |
| Government role | Maximum — runs everything | Minimum — sets rules only |
| Out-of-pocket costs | Near zero | High (25%+ of costs) |
| Risk pooling | Universal | Individual + catastrophic |
| Party alignment | **Democratic** | **Republican** |

### Good Things About the Free-Market Approach

1. **Singapore proves it works.** This isn't theory — 5.9 million people live under this system with excellent outcomes at a fraction of US costs.
2. **Eliminates the employer insurance trap.** Americans wouldn't be tied to jobs for health insurance — a massive labor market improvement.
3. **Reduces federal spending dramatically** — potentially $1–2 trillion, eliminating most of the deficit.
4. **Price transparency creates real competition.** When patients can see prices, hospitals compete on cost. The US currently has almost zero price transparency.
5. **Personal ownership is motivating.** When it's *your* money in *your* account, you don't waste it on unnecessary emergency room visits for a cold.
6. **HSA balances become retirement savings.** Healthy people accumulate wealth. This is popular with fiscal conservatives.
7. **Switzerland (a partial model) has 11.7% GDP spending** with market-based insurance mandates — still expensive by global standards but 30% cheaper than the US. Shows market models can work in Western contexts.

### Caveats and Problems

1. **Singapore is a city-state of 5.9 million people.** Scaling it to 335 million people across a continent-sized country with massive rural areas, extreme inequality, and a deeply entrenched existing system is a completely different challenge. Singapore has no rural access problem — everywhere is 30 minutes from a hospital.

2. **Americans are much sicker than Singaporeans.** Obesity rate: US 42%, Singapore ~10%. Diabetes prevalence: US 11%, Singapore ~8%. Chronic conditions drive ~90% of US healthcare spending. You can't "market compete" your way out of chronic disease — these patients need care regardless of price.

   > **Correlation note:** CDC data shows the US age-adjusted death rate varies from 568.7 (Hawaii) to 975.7 (Mississippi) per 100,000. States with the highest chronic disease burden (obesity, diabetes, smoking) have the highest death rates and the highest per-capita healthcare costs — regardless of which insurance model they use. A market system doesn't change the underlying health of the population. *(Source: CDC quarterly mortality rates 2025 Q1)*

3. **Out-of-pocket costs hit the poor hardest.** In Singapore, out-of-pocket costs are 25.4% of spending. For a family earning $50,000/year facing a $30,000 medical bill, a 25% copay ($7,500) is potentially catastrophic. Means-testing helps but doesn't eliminate the problem.

4. **Transition from employer-sponsored insurance is enormously disruptive.** 155 million Americans get insurance through their employer. Unwinding that system affects every company, every HR department, and every worker in the country simultaneously.

5. **Political feasibility: near zero from the left.** Democrats would fight this with everything they have — eliminating Medicare and Medicaid is unthinkable to the party. Seniors (who vote) would revolt.

6. **It doesn't solve the existing sick population.** Singapore built its system with a young, healthy population. The US would be transitioning while 70 million people are already on Medicare and have existing conditions. You can't put a 78-year-old with cancer into an HSA system — they have no time to accumulate savings.

7. **Healthcare isn't a normal market.** When you're having a heart attack, you don't price-shop ambulance services. Emergency care is inherently non-competitive. Many rural areas have only one hospital — there's no competition to drive prices down. And the information asymmetry between doctors and patients means "consumer choice" works differently than buying a TV.

### The Honest Assessment of the Free-Market Approach

**Fiscal realism: A−** — The savings potential is enormous. Singapore proves government health spending of 2.6% of GDP can produce excellent outcomes. Even getting halfway there would eliminate most of the deficit.

**Political realism: F** — This would require abolishing Medicare, the most popular government program in American history. No politician of either party will propose this. When Paul Ryan proposed *partial* Medicare reforms (premium support, not elimination), it nearly cost Republicans the 2012 election.

**Structural fix: B+** — It does genuinely address the fundamental cost structure of American healthcare. But it doesn't address the underlying health problems (obesity, chronic disease) that drive costs regardless of the payment model.

**The uncomfortable comparison:** Every single data point — spending, outcomes, life expectancy, government burden — shows that the countries at *both* extremes (Singapore's free market AND UK/Canada's single-payer) perform better than the US. What makes America's system uniquely expensive is not that it's too market-oriented or too government-driven — **it's that it's the worst of both worlds:** government pays most of the bill but doesn't negotiate prices, private companies skim profits and add administrative overhead, nobody has transparency, and the consumer has almost no skin in the game. The American system has the costs of a private system, the bureaucracy of a government system, and the benefits of neither.
> **The honest free-market problem:** The Singapore model is equally seductive on paper \u2014 4.5% of GDP for better outcomes than the US \u2014 but equally difficult in practice. Singapore is a city-state of 5.9 million with a young, healthy population and no rural access problem. The US has 335 million people, a 42% obesity rate, and vast rural areas where market competition simply doesn't exist (one hospital for 100 miles). Transitioning 70 million current Medicare recipients into health savings accounts is logistically and politically impossible \u2014 you can't tell a 78-year-old with cancer to start "saving." And healthcare isn't a normal market: when you're having a heart attack, you don't comparison-shop ambulance services. The free-market approach would require abolishing the most popular government program in American history (Medicare), which no politician of either party will propose.

## The Honest Answer

The best plan to fix the deficit is neither purely Democratic nor purely Republican. It's the plan that **neither party will propose because it requires angering their donors, their base, and their ideology simultaneously:**

| Component | Specific Mechanism | Playbook | Est. Annual Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Restore top income tax rate to 39.6%** | Let TCJA expire for incomes >$400K (was 37%, returns to pre-2017 level) | Democratic | +$200–300B |
| **Raise corporate tax rate to 25%** | Split the difference between current 21% and pre-2017 35% | Democratic | +$100–150B |
| **Tax capital gains at ordinary rates for >$1M** | Closes the loophole where investment income is taxed lower than wages | Democratic | +$150–200B |
| **Fund IRS enforcement** (+$20B/yr budget) | Close the $600B+ annual tax gap; every $1 returns $5–12 | Bipartisan | +$100–200B |
| **Cap discretionary spending growth at CPI** | Spending grows at 2.5% instead of 5–8%; savings compound annually | Republican | +$200–300B |
| **Raise Social Security retirement age to 69** | Phased in over 20 years (2 months/year). Reflects 78.4yr life expectancy vs 67 current age | Republican | +$50–100B |
| **Negotiate all Medicare drug prices** | Expand IRA's 10-drug negotiation to all branded drugs (as every other country does) | Bipartisan | +$100–200B |
| **Reduce defense spending to 2.5% of GDP** | Cut ~$300B from $501B. Still #1 in world by far (UK 2.3%, France 2.1%) | Neither (realistically) | +$250–300B |
| **Total** | | | **~$1.15T–$1.75T** |

> **A note on the balance of this table:** Three of the eight line items fall under the Democratic playbook (tax increases) and two under the Republican playbook (spending restraint), with the rest bipartisan or unaligned. This isn't editorial preference — it reflects the current fiscal math. Revenue is at 17.0% of GDP, the lowest sustained level since the 1950s, while spending is at 22.8%. To close a $1.82T gap, you need both more revenue *and* less spending, but the revenue side has further to travel to reach historical norms (19.8% during the surplus years) than the spending side does. The "playbook" labels indicate which party has traditionally championed each idea, not which party is right — both sides contain proposals that the data supports.

**What this means in practice:** A family earning $100,000 would see almost no change — the income tax increase only hits earnings above $400K. A family earning $500,000 would pay roughly $2,600 more per year in income taxes (the extra 2.6% on $100K above the threshold). A corporation earning $1B in profit would pay $40M more in taxes (25% vs 21%). A 45-year-old worker wouldn't be affected by the SS age change at all — it's phased in over 20 years. A senior on Medicare would pay less for prescription drugs. Military bases would close and some weapons programs would be canceled.

This would reduce the deficit from $1.82T to roughly **$100B–$700B** — not quite a surplus, but enough to stabilize and begin reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio. Adding healthcare system reform (from either the single-payer or free-market section above) could close the remaining gap entirely.

**The reason this won't happen** is the same reason it hasn't happened since 2001: it requires every elected official to simultaneously tell their voters something they don't want to hear. Republicans would have to admit that taxes need to go up. Democrats would have to admit that entitlements need to be restructured. Both would have to accept defense cuts in a dangerous world. And all of them would have to do this while facing voters who punish honesty and reward promises.

The last time it *did* happen — the late 1990s — it required a Democratic president willing to sign a Republican Congress's spending caps, a Republican Congress willing to live with a Democratic president's tax increases, a once-in-a-century tech boom, and the end of the Cold War. Lightning struck perfectly. It hasn't since.

**The deficit is not a mystery.** The math is simple: revenue minus spending. The problem is not that we don't know the answer — it's that the answer is politically impossible. And every year we wait, the interest on the debt makes the answer more expensive.
