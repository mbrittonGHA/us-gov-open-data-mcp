/**
 * SDK barrel export — import any SDK function without running the MCP server.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   import { searchBills, getBillDetails } from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk/congress";
 *   import { searchFilings } from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk/senate-lobbying";
 *
 * Or import everything:
 *   import * as sdk from "us-gov-open-data-mcp/sdk";
 *   const bills = await sdk.congress.searchBills({ congress: 118 });
 *
 * Each sub-module is a standalone typed client with caching, retry, and rate limiting.
 * No MCP or Zod dependency required — just set the relevant API key env var.
